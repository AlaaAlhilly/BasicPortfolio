            <p id ="firstp"><b>Life is beatiful and still only for people who pursue the dream.</b></p>
            <p>My dream is to be a profesional programmer, I know it needs a real
                hard work, it is not just snacking and imaging it may need you to
                change your whole life, change how you see things , and that is what I
            am doing right now.
            see!!! I seems to be a phylospher too :).
            so it was good to talk about my dream, now it's time to tell you my plan to do that:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find a program that develop a skill which in demand in now career market.</li>
                    <li>Study hard within the program and put your commitment and faith to finish it <br>as well as it requierd or even more.</li>
                    <li>Work hard on yourself and put all your potential in developing your skills of<br> communication and presentation to be as employer desire.</li>
                    <li>Get a good job that pay you enough and has a free time to use it to study.</li>
                    <li>Continue pursuing your dream of getting the Degrees and knowledge you plan to gain in your mind.</li>
                    <li>Remeber life is not easy for all people but maybe for some.<br><b> DON'T RELY ON LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST KEEP FITING.</b></li>
                </ul>
